## Rails - Simple response bot (aka "Stupid coaching")

I really like the simplicity of this app. You simply type something in and you get an appropriate response (mostly it's just telling me to go to work ðŸ™„). 

## Background

To get anything started on rails, it's vital to follow the MVC model and get the following up and running: 
* a route, 
* an action, 
* and a view

I tried my best to make my /answer a little more varied than what the exercise wanted, although the highlight of this exercise came later on when we had the option to use "Headless Chrome" for System Testing. So this exercise is really more about exploring how to test a code using a browser.
